# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:
    destructering is used to reduce the amount of code needed and to allow avaliblity to information not avalible before.

  Researched answer:
   It's a JavaScript expression that allows us to extract data from arrays, objects, maps and sets


2. What are the three arguments that .map() can accept?

  Your answer:
    value, index, function

  Researched answer:
    the value of the element, the index of the element, and the array object being mapped


3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:
  An object is a way to store data in a reusable way while a class can have an object, but also functions within which can be made independent with adding new versions of the class.

  Researched answer:
    Objects have states and behaviors. A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.


4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer:
  A span only takes in arguments like sending information to other components. While a div tag can display information and has its own padding.

  Researched answer:
    The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer:
  React.Fragment is a way to encompases all other tags inside a class render return without adding weird padding or other complications

  Researched answer:
    You can use fragments to create components that return a list of elements without wrapping them in a container or array. This is useful for components that return form and text markup â€” as wrapping the result in a container <div> can cause headaches when styling things


6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer:
  Allowing for resizing of the page avalible to be viewed on mobile devices without discomfort.

  Researched answer:
    Consistency, Consistency, Whitespace, Intuitive navigation, and Optimized images


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming
    refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.


- irb
    interactive Ruby Shell (IRB or irb) is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby. The abbreviation irb is a portmanteau of the word "interactive" and the filename extension for Ruby files, ". rb".

- Instance variable
    In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to a class variable.

- Ruby hash
    A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" = > "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.

- Class relationships
    This reusability is possible due to the relationship b/w the classes. Object oriented programming generally support 4 types of relationships that are: inheritance , association, composition and aggregation. All these relationship is based on "is a" relationship, "has-a" relationship and "part-of" relationship.
